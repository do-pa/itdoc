# What is itdoc?

Create reliable, test-driven API documentation – straight from your Node.js test code!

## Features

- 🧪 Test-driven API documentation generation
- 📄 Supports OpenAPI, Markdown, HTML output
- 🚫 Fails to generate docs if tests fail – ensures accuracy
- 🔧 Easy integration with your existing test suite
- 🧩 Framework-agnostic (Express, NestJS, Fastify, etc.)
- 🤖 GPT-powered test case generation for faster documentation

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to reliably document `RESTful web services` written in `JavaScript`. Unlike typical JSON or JSDoc-based API documentation, `itdoc` extracts request/response examples directly from test code. Since the documentation is only generated when tests pass, you can always publish the most up-to-date, verified API information.

`itdoc` combines your written descriptions with test results to generate documentation.

Test-based documentation will always reflect the actual behavior of your API. As long as your tests pass, you can export the documentation to formats such as OpenAPI Specification, Markdown, or HTML — and deploy it however you like.
