## What is itdoc?

Create reliable, test-driven API documentation.

## Features

- 🧪 Test-driven API documentation generation
- 📄 Supports OpenAPI, Markdown, HTML output(redocly style)
- 🚫 Fails to generate docs if tests fail – ensures accuracy
- 🔧 Easy integration with your existing test suite
- 🧩 Framework-agnostic (Express, NestJS, Fastify)
- 🤖 In addition, we offer automatic test generation powered by GPT

## Why itdoc needed? 

### Tired of unreliable API documentation?

For developers working with`JavaScript` or `TypeScript`, documenting RESTful web services is a constant challenge. The process is completely separate from testing; every code change requires updating your tests and then manually updating your documents. It's easy for them to fall out of sync, leaving you with documentation you can't trust.

###  Introducing itdoc 
itdoc fundamentally solves this problem by ensuring your documentation is a direct result of your verified code.

With itdoc, we don't just write documents; we produce them only after they've passed tests, ensuring they precisely match what the team has read

## 1. Just write itdoc code 
```js
const app = require("../expressApp.js")
const { describeAPI, itDoc, HttpStatus, field, HttpMethod } = require("itdoc")

const targetApp = app

describeAPI(
    HttpMethod.POST,
    "signup",
    {
        summary: "회원 가입 API",
        tag: "Auth",
        description: "사용자로 부터 아이디와 패스워드를 받아 회원가입을 수행합니다.",
    },
    targetApp,
    (apiDoc) => {
        itDoc("회원가입 성공", async () => {
            await apiDoc
                .test()
                .prettyPrint()
                .req()
                .body({
                    username: field("사용자 이름", "username"),
                    password: field("패스워드", "P@ssw0rd123!@#"),
                })
                .res()
                .status(HttpStatus.CREATED)
        })
...
```

## 2. Run test(with jest or mocha) 
<img src="/img/intro_0.png" alt="테스트 결과" /> 

## 3. Boom! Reliable documents are created.
When the test passes, the document is automatically created in types such as redocly html, oas, etc.
