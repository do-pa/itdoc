# Integration with Test Runner

In your project, you are likely using a test runner like `Jest` or `Mocha`. After writing tests as described in the [quick-start](quick-start) guide, when you **run your test framework**, it will automatically detect and execute the `itdoc` test code (`describeAPI()`, `itdoc()`, etc.).

During this process, `itdoc` extracts the API requests and responses from the test code you wrote to generate documentation.

## âœ… Important Things

When running tests, the test runner must execute against the path that includes the `itdoc` test code. If that path is not included, the test runner will not detect the `itdoc` test code.

Therefore, the `test` script in `package.json` should specify the path that includes the `itdoc` test code.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="jest" label="Jest" default>

        ```json
        {
            "scripts": {
                "test": "jest ."
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mocha" label="Mocha">

        ```json
        {
            "scripts": {
                "test": "mocha ."
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For detailed configuration methods, please refer to the official documentation of each test runner.
