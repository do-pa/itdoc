## How to Contribute

### Setting Up the Development Environment

Good news! Itdoc provides pre-configured `.vscode` and `.idea` directories for contributors using VS
Code and IntelliJ IDEA. These configurations ensure automatic code formatting. Additionally, we use
[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to automatically enforce coding conventions prior to
commits.

> **This means contributors don't need to manually format their code to meet project guidelines!**

### Issues

1. **Check existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, please ensure a similar issue does not
   already exist by using the search functionality on our
   [issues page](https://github.com/do-pa/itdoc/issues).
2. **Create clear and concise issues**: When creating an issue, always use the provided issue
   template. Clearly describe the issue, and if applicable, include:
    - Steps to reproduce the problem
    - Expected vs actual behavior
    - Screenshots or code snippets

### Pull Requests (PRs)

To ensure a smooth PR review and merge process, please follow these steps:

#### Before Committing

- Ensure all tests pass by running:
    ```shell
    pnpm test
    ```
- Whenever possible, add tests:
    - **Unit tests**: Place unit tests under `lib/tests/unit/`.
    - **Integration or complex tests**: Place these under the `examples/` directory.

#### Creating a Pull Request

- Clearly describe the changes you have made and why they are necessary.
- Reference any related issue numbers in your PR description (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Ensure your PR title is concise and descriptive of the change (e.g., "Fix issue with X", "Add
  feature Y").
- After creating a PR, monitor it for any comments or requested changes by maintainers or other
  contributors.

### Review Process

- PRs are reviewed by maintainers and may require adjustments based on feedback.
- Once approved and all checks pass, your PR will be merged.
